    "## The Basics\n",
    "### Filter\n",
    "Given an 32x32 image with RGB channels, we can represent it as a tensor of shape `(32, 32, 3)` which is (height, width, channels). When we perform convolution, we need a filter that has the same channel depth as the image. For example, we can use a 5x5 filter which is of shape `(5, 5, 3)` and slide it across the image left to right, top to bottom with a stride of 1 to perform convolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Padding\n",
    "Question is, since we are starting from the top left corner, what if the filter goes index out of bound? We can use zero padding in this case. Thus, now we have four hyperparameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### No padding\n",
    "Filter size of 3x3, stride is 1 and with no padding\n",
    "![conv_no_padding](img/conv_no_padding.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### With padding and stride of 2\n",
    "Filter size of 3x3, stride is 2 and with padding\n",
    "![conv_padding](img/conv_padding.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "* `F`: number of filters\n",
    "* `Hf` or `Wf`: spatial extend of the filters, which is 5 in this case\n",
    "* `S`: stride size\n",
    "* `P`: amount of padding\n",
    "\n",
    "Ignore the example in the picture and use the original example, let's assume `padding=2` and `stride=1`:"
